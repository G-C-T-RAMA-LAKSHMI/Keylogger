# Keylogger 
Keyloggers are activity-monitoring software programs that give hackers access to your 
personal data. The passwords and credit card numbers you type, the webpages you visit 
– all by logging your keyboard strokes. The software is installed on your computer and 
records everything you type. Then it sends this log file to a server, where cybercriminals 
wait to make use of all this sensitive information.

Types of Keyloggers

• Hardware Keylogger: Devices that can be attached in our computer will act as 
keylogger and collects information about specified target.

• Software Keylogger: Probably a malicious program that does not infect your 
system but still can steal your passwords, account details etc.

Users may be tricked into downloading and installing keyloggers by a variety of social 
engineering techniques, such as Web Page Scripts, Phishing, unsolicited/spam mails 
containing attachments that have malware embedded in them. 

Once such emails are opened and attachments activated the malware gets discreetly 
downloaded and installed on your device. The malware could be a keylogger that 
captures and sends all the keyboard taps to the fraudsters, which includes your account 
passwords and other sensitive data.
